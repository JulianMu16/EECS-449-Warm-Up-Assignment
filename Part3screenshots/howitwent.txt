I did not have any major issues with the code along, but I did struggle implementing walkers in 
jac for part 1. After doing some self studying online and looking over the documentation I was 
able to get them to work. I think the code along was well structured and easy to follow, 
I especially liked the freedom we were given when it came to choosing our LLMs, 
since I was able to try a couple out. Overall it was enjoyable and I do appreciate 
the suggestion to use MongoDB via Docker as it is much simpler than the manual way.
